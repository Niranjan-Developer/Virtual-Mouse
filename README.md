A virtual mouse is software that allows users to give mouse inputs to a system without using an actual mouse. To the extreme, it can also be called hardware because it uses an ordinary web camera. A virtual mouse can usually be operated with multiple input devices, which may include an actual mouse or a computer keyboard. The virtual mouse, which uses a web camera, works with the help of different image processing techniques.
